## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**
- Required Python packages: `requests`, `art`, `rich`, `pyperclip`

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdo-omran2206/Gofilecli.git
   cd Gofilecli
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 💻 Usage

Start the CLI by running the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can also safely exit anytime by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

### Navigation & Options

Upon launching, you will interact with the following options:

1. **Upload File**: Provide the local file path. Once uploaded, the download link is generated and can be automatically copied to your clipboard.
2. **Upload Folder**: Provide a folder path to upload all files inside it as a single grouped directory on GoFile. Requires an API token — guest users will be prompted to add one first.
3. **View History**: Access a list of all your previous uploads. Select a file ID to view its details, re-copy the download link, or delete it from history.
4. **Account**: Login using your GoFile API token to switch from "Guest" to "Active" status, allowing your uploads to be linked to your account.
5. **Settings**: Clear your local upload history database or manually toggle your account status.
6. **Exit**: Safely close the application and release all resources.

> **💡 Where to get your GoFile token?**  
> Sign up at [gofile.io](https://gofile.io/), then go to your **Profile → API Token** to copy it.

## 🗄️ Local Data

GoFileCLI stores its data securely on your local machine:
- **Database**: Upload logs are stored in an SQLite database at `data/gofilecli.db`.
- **Configuration**: Your API token and account status are stored in `config/config.json`.
